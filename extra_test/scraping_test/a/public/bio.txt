üßê About Me
üëã Hi there! I'm Animikh, a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for Anime and Video Games. I'm currently working as a Computer Vision and Machine Learning Engineer at Moultrie - An EBSCO Company. Here, we're developing next-generation Computer Vision algorithms for Cellular Trail Cameras, aimed at enhancing wildlife monitoring.
I graduated with an MS in AI from Boston University, where I worked under Prof. Eshed Ohn-Bar at the H2X Lab. My research focused on end-to-end Autonomous Driving, specifically on closing the Sim2Real gap and developing offline and online driving evaluation metrics for my thesis.
Previously, I was the Computer Vision Engineer and Lead at Wobot.ai, where I spearheaded the development of a robust deep learning tech stack that powers real-time video analytics across hundreds of cameras worldwide.
I ‚ù§Ô∏è building things and strongly believe that Multi-Modal Self-Supervised Learning is key to AGI ü§´. My areas of focus include Generative AI, Multi-Modal Learning, and more.
I'm always open to new opportunities and a good chat ‚òï. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out at animikhaich@gmail.com.
