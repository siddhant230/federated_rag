Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics.[1][6] His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called \"the world's most famous equation\".[7] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.[8]\n\nBorn in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, and at the age of seventeen he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school. In 1903, he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews,[9] Einstein decided to remain in the US.[10] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommended that the US begin similar research, though he generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1515, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"1091e2df-d32b-496a-8034-43360b54b985": {"node_ids": ["8162cbcd-9a92-4dcd-9333-225099632f25"], "metadata": {"file_path": "../test_group/a/public/bio.txt", "file_name": "bio.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1532, "creation_date": "2024-11-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-21"}}}}
